1:45 PM

@BrettMiller_IT @greggZ251 @Schlauge that can be arranged. we might even be able to send a care package... #PSTweetChat

@BrettMiller_IT @greggZ251 @Schlauge time is such a weird constraint... nothing a few cold ones or a gin cant offset. #PSTweetChat


1:44 PM
Phil Bossman @Schlauge
@WindosNZ @code @pcgeek86 I'll need to check this out #PSTweetChat


1:43 PM
Gregg Lott @greggZ251
@WindosNZ Getting ready to give it a spin and see. #PSTweetChat


1:43 PM
Dave Carroll @thedavecarroll
@BrettMiller_IT @Schlauge @code This is cool if you have multiple systems to keep the config in sync. #PSTweetChat


1:42 PM
Jeff Hicks @JeffHicks
@WindosNZ The ISE made it easy to have remote tabs. I applied the concept to Windows Terminal. I'll have to blog about it. #pstweetchat


1:42 PM
Dave Carroll @thedavecarroll
@BrettMiller_IT @Schlauge @code I use this extension. Pretty cool! #PSTweetChat


1:40 PM
Josh (Windos) King @WindosNZ
@JeffHicks That's a really awesome idea, esp for those handfuls of remote sessions you tend to need regularly! #PSTweetChat

@Schlauge @greggZ251 @MikeKanakos the benefits of using one editor totally outweighs any negatives or nuances you may run into. #PSTweetChat


1:38 PM
Phil Bossman @Schlauge
@greggZ251 @BrettMiller_IT @MikeKanakos Truly,, whats else would you use? #VSCode is so versatile #PSTweetChat


1:38 PM
Brett Miller @BrettMiller_IT
@greggZ251 @MikeKanakos I'm using @code for everything. Azure Data Studio for SQL stuff. Pretty much the same thing though. #PSTweetChat


1:38 PM

@greggZ251 @BrettMiller_IT absolutely! #PSTweetChat

@MikeKanakos #PowerShell7 is my default, but for work it's still Windows PowerShell 5.1 #PSTweetChat #PowerShell


1:37 PM
Mike Kanakos @MikeKanakos
@BrettMiller_IT that's why i love VSCode so much.... the ability to do many things from one console. #PSTweetChat #powershell


1:37 PM
Gregg Lott @greggZ251
@BrettMiller_IT @MikeKanakos Are you using VSCode for markdown? #PSTweetChat

1:30 PM
Jeff Hicks @JeffHicks
@MikeKanakos Oh, you mean the proper date format? ;-) #PSTweetChat


1:30 PM
Gregg Lott @greggZ251
@JeffHicks @MikeKanakos That is where I run 7 from most of the time along with a WSL window. #PSTweetChat


1:29 PM
Mike Kanakos @MikeKanakos
@JeffHicks I am moving that way now! #PSTweetChat


1:29 PM
Josh (Windos) King @WindosNZ
@MikeKanakos Unfortunately I'm tied to a SOAP API at work that is *way* more convenient in 5.1, but I use 7 as much as I can. #PSTweetChat


1:29 PM
Jeff Hicks @JeffHicks
@MikeKanakos I'm more curious when people will move to Windows Terminal in place of the traditional console. #pstweetchat


1:29 PM
Mike Kanakos @MikeKanakos
@JeffHicks that's not the date format I would have expected to see... #PSTweetChat


1:28 PM
Gregg Lott @greggZ251
@MikeKanakos I use it every day at work unless I don't have a choice. #PSTweetChat
